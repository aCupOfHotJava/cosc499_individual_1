_New_ in latest version: character sorting support!

This program does everything it did before, but is now able to sort
arrays of characters!

An array is populated with 100 characters generated randomly between
ASCII A and Z in integer format. From this we can compare their values
in much the same way as we did with the integer array. Consult the
bottom of the README for instructions on how to run.

-------------------------------- **OLD** --------------------------------

The program will sort an integer array.

An array of size 100 indices will be populated with random integers
and then will be sorted in increasing order.

In order to run the program - in my case, have Visual Studio Code installed,
install the Java Language Support package from Red Hat, Debugger for Java by
Microsoft, and have an up-to-date JDK installed on the machine. Afterwards, 
navigate to "Run" and then "Start with debugging." Output of the sort can be
seen at the bottom of the window in the Terminal.
